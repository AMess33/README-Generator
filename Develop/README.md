# WorkDay-Scheduler
## A daily plannar to schedule and save your tasks by each hour of the workday
- This webpage will allow me to stay organized and up to date on my daily work tasks.
- I built this to have a visual representation of my day and all the work I need to accomplish.
- This will help me identify what time of day it is and the task I need to complete at that time.
- I learned how to dynamically add styling to portions of the html based on the time of day, using the day.js api and its various properties.
