# README Generator

## A NODE program that creates a professional README.md file.

- I wanted to build a ReadMe template to use on future projects.
- To make future projects quicker by auto generating a ReadMe file.
- This will allow me to save time when creating ReadMe files by having a template to ask the relevant questions and lower the time it takes to create a file from scratch.
- I learned how to use the NODE environment as well as the Inquirer NPM library.


## Usage

When you run node index.js within the terminal you will be prompted with relevant questions that you need to answer for a Professional README file. Once you answer the first question and hit ENTER, the next question comes up. Once you answer all of the questions the Node provides, a README.md file is created in your directory.
